# Emporium

A simple web shop written in elixir / phoenix.

It will have Products, Customers, Carts and Orders 

# Milestones

I have a  [list of features](Milestones.md) I want to implement, and I splitted it in four sections:

* *Clickable dummy* - something I can show on my own laptop
* *Proof of Concept* - something that other developers can have a look at
* *Before v1.0* - the bare necessities to start my own litte shop selling boardgame replacement parts done by laser cutter (yoo read it here first)
* *After v1.2* - things I'd like to implement 

he gap between the later two is due to hard earned knowledge that after v1.0 all plans are off and new priorities will present themselves.
